# cpp-renderer
C++ 3D renderer, using SDL2. Work in progress, nowhere near the point where I would consider it acceptable.  
Some crashes to expect, don't worry and launch again.

> [!WARNING]\
> Make sure to include [SDL2](https://github.com/davidsiaw/SDL2) and [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) (in folders `/src/include` and `/src/bin` respectively)
